# NOTE: Because CircleCI jobs run on separate machines from each other, we duplicate steps (like checkout) between jobs. This is because doing the "correct" DRY
#  refactoring of, "one job for checkout, one job for build Docker image, etc." would require a) persisting files between jobs and b) persisting Docker images between
#  jobs. Both are annoying (saving/loading workspaces require re-downloading the workspace over the network, and there doesn't seem to be a good way to do Docker
#  images), so we run everything inside a single job.
