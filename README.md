# Ethereum Package

![Run of the Ethereum Network Package](run.gif)

This is a [Kurtosis][kurtosis-repo] package that will spin up a private Ethereum testnet over Docker or Kubernetes with multi-client support, Flashbot's `mev-boost` infrastructure for PBS-related testing/validation, and other useful network tools (transaction spammer, monitoring tools, etc). Kurtosis packages are entirely reproducible and composable, so this will work the same way over Docker or Kubernetes, in the cloud or locally on your machine.

You now have the ability to spin up a private Ethereum testnet or public devnet/testnet (e.g. Goerli, Holesky, Sepolia, dencun-devnet-12, verkle-gen-devnet-2 etc) with a single command. This package is designed to be used for testing, validation, and development of Ethereum clients, and is not intended for production use. For more details check network_params.network in the [configuration section](./README.md#configuration).

Specifically, this [package][package-reference] will:

1. Generate Execution Layer (EL) & Consensus Layer (CL) genesis information using [the Ethereum genesis generator](https://github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-genesis-generator).
2. Configure & bootstrap a network of Ethereum nodes of *n* size using the genesis data generated above
3. Spin up a [transaction spammer](https://github.com/MariusVanDerWijden/tx-fuzz) to send fake transactions to the network
4. Spin up and connect a [testnet verifier](https://github.com/ethereum/merge-testnet-verifier)
5. Spin up a Grafana and Prometheus instance to observe the network
6. Spin up a Blobscan instance to analyze blob transactions (EIP-4844)

Optional features (enabled via flags or parameter files at runtime):

* Block until the Beacon nodes finalize an epoch (i.e. finalized_epoch > 0)
* Spin up & configure parameters for the infrastructure behind Flashbot's implementation of PBS using `mev-boost`, in either `full` or `mock` mode. More details [here](./README.md#proposer-builder-separation-pbs-implementation-via-flashbots-mev-boost-protocol).
* Spin up & connect the network to a [beacon metrics gazer service](https://github.com/dapplion/beacon-metrics-gazer) to collect network-wide participation metrics.
* Spin up and connect a [JSON RPC Snooper](https://github.com/ethDreamer/json_rpc_snoop) to the network log responses & requests between the EL engine API and the CL client.
* Specify extra parameters to be passed in for any of the: CL client Beacon, and CL client validator, and/or EL client containers
* Specify the required parameters for the nodes to reach an external block building network
* Generate keystores for each node in parallel

## Quickstart

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/new/?editor=code#https://github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-package)

1. [Install Docker & start the Docker Daemon if you haven't done so already][docker-installation]
2. [Install the Kurtosis CLI, or upgrade it to the latest version if it's already installed][kurtosis-cli-installation]
3. Run the package with default configurations from the command line:

   ```bash
   kurtosis run --enclave my-testnet github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-package
   ```

#### Run with your own configuration

Kurtosis packages are parameterizable, meaning you can customize your network and its behavior to suit your needs by storing parameters in a file that you can pass in at runtime like so:

```bash
kurtosis run --enclave my-testnet github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-package --args-file network_params.yaml
```

Where `network_params.yaml` contains the parameters for your network in your home directory.

#### Run on Kubernetes

Kurtosis packages work the same way over Docker or on Kubernetes. Please visit our [Kubernetes docs](https://docs.kurtosis.com/k8s) to learn how to spin up a private testnet on a Kubernetes cluster.

#### Considerations for Running on a Public Testnet with a Cloud Provider
When running on a public testnet using a cloud provider's Kubernetes cluster, there are a few important factors to consider:

1. State Growth: The growth of the state might be faster than anticipated. This could potentially lead to issues if the default parameters become insufficient over time. It's important to monitor state growth and adjust parameters as necessary.

2. Persistent Storage Speed: Most cloud providers provision their Kubernetes clusters with relatively slow persistent storage by default. This can cause performance issues, particularly with Execution Layer (EL) clients.

3. Network Syncing: The disk speed provided by cloud providers may not be sufficient to sync with networks that have high demands, such as the mainnet. This could lead to syncing issues and delays.

To mitigate these issues, you can use the `el_volume_size` and `cl_volume_size` flags to override the default settings locally. This allows you to allocate more storage to the EL and CL clients, which can help accommodate faster state growth and improve syncing performance. However, keep in mind that increasing the volume size may also increase your cloud provider costs. Always monitor your usage and adjust as necessary to balance performance and cost.

For optimal performance, we recommend using a cloud provider that allows you to provision Kubernetes clusters with fast persistent storage or self hosting your own Kubernetes cluster with fast persistent storage.

### Shadowforking
In order to enable shadowfork capabilities, you can use the `network_params.network` flag. The expected value is the name of the network you want to shadowfork followed by `-shadowfork`. Please note that `persistent` configuration parameter has to be enabled for shadowforks to work! Current limitation on k8s is it is only working on a single node cluster. For example, to shadowfork the Holesky testnet, you can use the following command:
```yaml
...
network_params:
  network: "holesky-shadowfork"
persistent: true
...
```

##### Shadowforking custom verkle networks
In order to enable shadowfork capabilities for verkle networks, you need to define electra and mention verkle in the network name after shadowfork.
```yaml
...
network_params:
  electra_fork_epoch: 1
  network: "holesky-shadowfork-verkle"
persistent: true
...
```

#### Taints and tolerations
It is possible to run the package on a Kubernetes cluster with taints and tolerations. This is done by adding the tolerations to the `tolerations` field in the `network_params.yaml` file. For example:
```yaml
participants:
  - el_type: reth
    cl_type: teku
global_tolerations:
  - key: "node-role.kubernetes.io/master6"
    value: "true"
    operator: "Equal"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
```

It is possible to define toleration globally, per participant or per container. The order of precedence is as follows:
1. Container (`el_tolerations`, `cl_tolerations`, `vc_tolerations`)
2. Participant (`tolerations`)
3. Global (`global_tolerations`)

This feature is only available for Kubernetes. To learn more about taints and tolerations, please visit the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/).

#### Tear down

The testnet will reside in an [enclave][enclave] - an isolated, ephemeral environment. The enclave and its contents (e.g. running containers, files artifacts, etc) will persist until torn down. You can remove an enclave and its contents with:

```bash
kurtosis enclave rm -f my-testnet
```

## Management

The [Kurtosis CLI](https://docs.kurtosis.com/cli) can be used to inspect and interact with the network.

For example, if you need shell access, simply run:

```bash
kurtosis service shell my-testnet $SERVICE_NAME
```

And if you need the logs for a service, simply run:

```bash
kurtosis service logs my-testnet $SERVICE_NAME
```

Check out the full list of CLI commands [here](https://docs.kurtosis.com/cli)

## Debugging

To grab the genesis files for the network, simply run:

```bash
kurtosis files download my-testnet $FILE_NAME $OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
```

For example, to retrieve the Execution Layer (EL) genesis data, run:

```bash
kurtosis files download my-testnet el-genesis-data ~/Downloads
```

# Basic file sharing

Apache is included in the package to allow for basic file sharing. The Apache service is started when additional services are enabled. It will expose the network-configs directory, which might needed if you want to share the network config publicly.

```yaml
additional_services:
  - apache
```

## Configuration

## Custom labels for Docker and Kubernetes

There are 4 custom labels that can be used to identify the nodes in the network. These labels are used to identify the nodes in the network and can be used to run chaos tests on specific nodes. An example for these labels are as follows:

Execution Layer (EL) nodes:

```sh
  "com.kurtosistech.custom.ethereum-package-client": "geth",
  "com.kurtosistech.custom.ethereum-package-client-image": "ethereum-client-go-latest",
  "com.kurtosistech.custom.ethereum-package-client-type": "execution",
  "com.kurtosistech.custom.ethereum-package-connected-client": "lighthouse",
```

Consensus Layer (CL) nodes - Beacon:

```sh
  "com.kurtosistech.custom.ethereum-package-client": "lighthouse",
  "com.kurtosistech.custom.ethereum-package-client-image": "sigp-lighthouse-latest",
  "com.kurtosistech.custom.ethereum-package-client-type": "beacon",
  "com.kurtosistech.custom.ethereum-package-connected-client": "geth",
```

Consensus Layer (CL) nodes - Validator:

```sh
  "com.kurtosistech.custom.ethereum-package-client": "lighthouse",
  "com.kurtosistech.custom.ethereum-package-client-image": "sigp-lighthouse-latest",
  "com.kurtosistech.custom.ethereum-package-client-type": "validator",
  "com.kurtosistech.custom.ethereum-package-connected-client": "geth",
```

`ethereum-package-client` describes which client is running on the node.
`ethereum-package-client-image` describes the image that is used for the client.
`ethereum-package-client-type` describes the type of client that is running on the node (`execution`,`beacon` or `validator`).
`ethereum-package-connected-client` describes the CL/EL client that is connected to the EL/CL client.

## Proposer Builder Separation (PBS) emulation

To spin up the network of Ethereum nodes with an external block building network (using Flashbot's `mev-boost` protocol), simply use:

```
kurtosis run github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-package '{"mev_type": "full"}'
```

Starting your network up with `"mev_type": "full"` will instantiate and connect the following infrastructure to your network:

1. `Flashbot's block builder & CL validator + beacon` - A modified Geth client that builds blocks. The CL validator and beacon clients are lighthouse clients configured to receive payloads from the relay.
2. `mev-relay-api` - Services that provide APIs for (a) proposers, (b) block builders, (c) data
3. `mev-relay-website` - A website to monitor payloads that have been delivered
4. `mev-relay-housekeeper` - Updates known validators, proposer duties, and more in the background. Only a single instance of this should run.
5. `mev-boost` - open-source middleware instantiated for each EL/Cl pair in the network, including the builder
6. `mev-flood` - Deploys UniV2 smart contracts, provisions liquidity on UniV2 pairs, & sends a constant stream of UniV2 swap transactions to the network's public mempool.

<details>
    <summary>Caveats when using "mev_type": "full"</summary>

* Validators (64 per node by default, so 128 in the example in this guide) will get registered with the relay automatically after the 1st epoch. This registration process is simply a configuration addition to the mev-boost config - which Kurtosis will automatically take care of as part of the set up. This means that the mev-relay infrastructure only becomes aware of the existence of the validators after the 1st epoch.
* After the 3rd epoch, the mev-relay service will begin to receive execution payloads (eth_sendPayload, which does not contain transaction content) from the mev-builder service (or mock-builder in mock-mev mode).
* Validators will start to receive validated execution payload headers from the mev-relay service (via mev-boost) after the 4th epoch. The validator selects the most valuable header, signs the payload, and returns the signed header to the relay - effectively proposing the payload of transactions to be included in the soon-to-be-proposed block. Once the relay verifies the block proposer's signature, the relay will respond with the full execution payload body (incl. the transaction contents) for the validator to use when proposing a SignedBeaconBlock to the network.

</details>

This package also supports a `"mev_type": "mock"` mode that will only bring up:

1. `mock-builder` - a server that listens for builder API directives and responds with payloads built using an execution client
1. `mev-boost` - for every EL/CL pair launched

For more details, including a guide and architecture of the `mev-boost` infrastructure, go [here](https://docs.kurtosis.com/how-to-full-mev-with-ethereum-package/).
