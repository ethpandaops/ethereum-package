# Ethereum Package

This is a [Kurtosis Starlark Package][starlark-docs] that will:

1. Generate EL & CL genesis information using [this genesis generator](https://github.com/skylenet/ethereum-genesis-generator)
1. Spin up a network of Eth2 Beacon/validator clients
1. Add [a transaction spammer](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/tx-fuzz) that will repeatedly send transactions to the network
1. Launch [a consensus monitor](https://github.com/ralexstokes/ethereum_consensus_monitor) instance attached to the network
1. Optionally block until the Beacon nodes finalize an epoch (i.e. finalized_epoch > 0)

For much more detailed information about how the merge works in Ethereum testnets, see [this document](https://notes.ethereum.org/@ExXcnR0-SJGthjz1dwkA1A/H1MSKgm3F).

## Quickstart

1. [Install Docker if you haven't done so already][docker-installation]
1. [Install the Kurtosis CLI, or upgrade it to the latest version if it's already installed][kurtosis-cli-installation]
1. Ensure your Docker engine is running:
   ```bash
   docker image ls
   ```
1. Run the package:
   ```bash
   kurtosis run --enclave eth2 github.com/kurtosis-tech/eth2-package
   ```

To remove the enclave running the Ethereum network, run `kurtosis enclave rm -f eth2`.

You can customize the package's behaviour by passing in a configuration JSON or YAML (see the "Configuration" section below). For example:

```bash
kurtosis run --enclave eth2 github.com/kurtosis-tech/eth2-package '{"global_client_log_level": "info"}'
```

For extra convenience, you can store the parameters in a file:

1. Create a file in your home directory `eth2-package-params.json` with the following contents:

   ```yaml
   global_client_log_level: "info"
   ```

1. Run the package, passing in the params from the file:
   ```bash
   kurtosis run --enclave eth2 github.com/kurtosis-tech/eth2-package "$(cat ~/eth2-package-params.json)"
   ```

## Management

Kurtosis will create a new enclave to house the services of the Ethereum network. [This page][using-the-cli] contains documentation for managing the created enclave & viewing detailed information about it.

## Configuration

To configure the package behaviour, you can modify your `eth2-package-params.yaml` file. The full YAML schema that can be passed in is as follows with the defaults provided:

## Developing On This Package

First, install prerequisites:

1. [Install Kurtosis itself][kurtosis-cli-installation]

Then, run the dev loop:

1. Make your code changes
1. Rebuild and re-run the package by running the following from the root of the repo:
   ```bash
   kurtosis run . "{}"
   ```
   NOTE 1: You can change the value of the second positional argument flag to pass in extra configuration to the package per the "Configuration" section above!
   NOTE 2: The second positional argument accepts JSON.

To get detailed information about the structure of the package, visit [the architecture docs](./docs/architecture.md).

When you're happy with your changes:

- Add an entry to `docs/changelog.md` under the `# TBD` header describing your changes (this is required for CI checks to pass!)
- Create a PR
- Add one of the maintainers of the repo as a "Review Request":
  - `parithosh` (Ethereum)
  - `gbouv` (Kurtosis)
  - `h4ck3rk3y` (Kurtosis)
  - `mieubrisse` (Kurtosis)
- Once everything works, merge!

## Known Bugs

`wait_for_epoch_finalization` - doesn't work as expected, as Starlark doesn't have ways to do assertions on facts just yet. The [issue](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/eth2-package/issues/15) tracks this.
