# Ethereum Package

![Run of the Ethereum Network Package](run.gif)

This is a [Kurtosis][kurtosis-repo] package that will spin up a private Ethereum testnet over Docker or Kubernetes with multi-client support, Flashbot's `mev-boost` infrastructure for PBS-related testing/validation, and other useful network tools (transaction spammer, monitoring tools, etc). Kurtosis packages are entirely reproducible and composable, so this will work the same way over Docker or Kubernetes, in the cloud or locally on your machine.

Specifically, this [package][package-reference] will:

1. Generate Execution Layer (EL) & Consensus Layer (CL) genesis information using [the Ethereum genesis generator](https://github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-genesis-generator).
2. Configure & bootstrap a network of Ethereum nodes of *n* size using the genesis data generated above
3. Spin up a [transaction spammer](https://github.com/MariusVanDerWijden/tx-fuzz) to send fake transactions to the network
4. Spin up and connect a [testnet verifier](https://github.com/ethereum/merge-testnet-verifier)
5. Spin up a Grafana and Prometheus instance to observe the network
6. Spin up a Blobscan instance to analyze blob transactions (EIP-4844)

Optional features (enabled via flags or parameter files at runtime):

* Block until the Beacon nodes finalize an epoch (i.e. finalized_epoch > 0)
* Spin up & configure parameters for the infrastructure behind Flashbot's implementation of PBS using `mev-boost`, in either `full` or `mock` mode. More details [here](./README.md#proposer-builder-separation-pbs-implementation-via-flashbots-mev-boost-protocol).
* Spin up & connect the network to a [beacon metrics gazer service](https://github.com/dapplion/beacon-metrics-gazer) to collect network-wide participation metrics.
* Spin up and connect a [JSON RPC Snooper](https://github.com/ethDreamer/json_rpc_snoop) to the network log responses & requests between the EL engine API and the CL client.
* Specify extra parameters to be passed in for any of the: CL client Beacon, and CL client validator, and/or EL client containers
* Specify the required parameters for the nodes to reach an external block building network
* Generate keystores for each node in parallel

## Quickstart

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/new/?editor=code#https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/ethereum-package)

1. [Install Docker & start the Docker Daemon if you haven't done so already][docker-installation]
2. [Install the Kurtosis CLI, or upgrade it to the latest version if it's already installed][kurtosis-cli-installation]
3. Run the package with default configurations from the command line:

   ```bash
   kurtosis run --enclave my-testnet github.com/kurtosis-tech/ethereum-package
   ```

#### Run with your own configuration

Kurtosis packages are parameterizable, meaning you can customize your network and its behavior to suit your needs by storing parameters in a file that you can pass in at runtime like so:

```bash
kurtosis run --enclave my-testnet github.com/kurtosis-tech/ethereum-package "$(cat ~/network_params.yaml)"
```

Where `network_params.yaml` contains the parameters for your network in your home directory.

#### Run on Kubernetes

Kurtosis packages work the same way over Docker or on Kubernetes. Please visit our [Kubernetes docs](https://docs.kurtosis.com/k8s) to learn how to spin up a private testnet on a Kubernetes cluster.

#### Tear down

The testnet will reside in an [enclave][enclave] - an isolated, ephemeral environment. The enclave and its contents (e.g. running containers, files artifacts, etc) will persist until torn down. You can remove an enclave and its contents with:

```bash
kurtosis enclave rm -f my-testnet
```

## Management

The [Kurtosis CLI](https://docs.kurtosis.com/cli) can be used to inspect and interact with the network.

For example, if you need shell access, simply run:

```bash
kurtosis service shell my-testnet $SERVICE_NAME
```

And if you need the logs for a service, simply run:

```bash
kurtosis service logs my-testnet $SERVICE_NAME
```

Check out the full list of CLI commands [here](https://docs.kurtosis.com/cli)

## Debugging

To grab the genesis files for the network, simply run:

```bash
kurtosis files download my-testnet $FILE_NAME $OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
```

For example, to retrieve the Execution Layer (EL) genesis data, run:

```bash
kurtosis files download my-testnet el-genesis-data ~/Downloads
```

## Configuration

To configure the package behaviour, you can modify your `network_params.yaml` file. The full YAML schema that can be passed in is as follows with the defaults provided:

## Custom labels for Docker and Kubernetes

There are 4 custom labels that can be used to identify the nodes in the network. These labels are used to identify the nodes in the network and can be used to run chaos tests on specific nodes. An example for these labels are as follows:

Execution Layer (EL) nodes:

```sh
  "com.kurtosistech.custom.ethereum-package-client": "geth",
  "com.kurtosistech.custom.ethereum-package-client-image": "ethereum-client-go-latest",
  "com.kurtosistech.custom.ethereum-package-client-type": "execution",
  "com.kurtosistech.custom.ethereum-package-connected-client": "lighthouse",
```

Consensus Layer (CL) nodes - Beacon:

```sh
  "com.kurtosistech.custom.ethereum-package-client": "lighthouse",
  "com.kurtosistech.custom.ethereum-package-client-image": "sigp-lighthouse-latest",
  "com.kurtosistech.custom.ethereum-package-client-type": "beacon",
  "com.kurtosistech.custom.ethereum-package-connected-client": "geth",
```

Consensus Layer (CL) nodes - Validator:

```sh
  "com.kurtosistech.custom.ethereum-package-client": "lighthouse",
  "com.kurtosistech.custom.ethereum-package-client-image": "sigp-lighthouse-latest",
  "com.kurtosistech.custom.ethereum-package-client-type": "validator",
  "com.kurtosistech.custom.ethereum-package-connected-client": "geth",
```

`ethereum-package-client` describes which client is running on the node.
`ethereum-package-client-image` describes the image that is used for the client.
`ethereum-package-client-type` describes the type of client that is running on the node (`execution`,`beacon` or `validator`).
`ethereum-package-connected-client` describes the CL/EL client that is connected to the EL/CL client.

## Proposer Builder Separation (PBS) emulation

To spin up the network of Ethereum nodes with an external block building network (using Flashbot's `mev-boost` protocol), simply use:

```
kurtosis run github.com/kurtosis-tech/ethereum-package '{"mev_type": "full"}'
```

Starting your network up with `"mev_type": "full"` will instantiate and connect the following infrastructure to your network:

1. `Flashbot's block builder & CL validator + beacon` - A modified Geth client that builds blocks. The CL validator and beacon clients are lighthouse clients configured to receive payloads from the relay.
2. `mev-relay-api` - Services that provide APIs for (a) proposers, (b) block builders, (c) data
3. `mev-relay-website` - A website to monitor payloads that have been delivered
4. `mev-relay-housekeeper` - Updates known validators, proposer duties, and more in the background. Only a single instance of this should run.
5. `mev-boost` - open-source middleware instantiated for each EL/Cl pair in the network, including the builder
6. `mev-flood` - Deploys UniV2 smart contracts, provisions liquidity on UniV2 pairs, & sends a constant stream of UniV2 swap transactions to the network's public mempool.

<details>
    <summary>Caveats when using "mev_type": "full"</summary>

* Validators (64 per node by default, so 128 in the example in this guide) will get registered with the relay automatically after the 1st epoch. This registration process is simply a configuration addition to the mev-boost config - which Kurtosis will automatically take care of as part of the set up. This means that the mev-relay infrastructure only becomes aware of the existence of the validators after the 1st epoch.
* After the 3rd epoch, the mev-relay service will begin to receive execution payloads (eth_sendPayload, which does not contain transaction content) from the mev-builder service (or mock-builder in mock-mev mode).
* Validators will start to receive validated execution payload headers from the mev-relay service (via mev-boost) after the 4th epoch. The validator selects the most valuable header, signs the payload, and returns the signed header to the relay - effectively proposing the payload of transactions to be included in the soon-to-be-proposed block. Once the relay verifies the block proposer's signature, the relay will respond with the full execution payload body (incl. the transaction contents) for the validator to use when proposing a SignedBeaconBlock to the network.

It is recommended to use non zero value for `capella_fork_epoch` by setting `network_params.capella_fork_epoch` to a non-zero value
in the arguments passed with `mev_type` set to `full`.
</details>

This package also supports a `"mev_type": "mock"` mode that will only bring up:

1. `mock-builder` - a server that listens for builder API directives and responds with payloads built using an execution client
1. `mev-boost` - for every EL/CL pair launched

For more details, including a guide and architecture of the `mev-boost` infrastructure, go [here](https://docs.kurtosis.com/how-to-full-mev-with-ethereum-package/).

## MEV-Boost usage with Capella at Epoch 0

This note is from 2023-10-05

`flashbots/mev-boost-relay:0.27` and later support `capella_fork_epoch` at `0` but this seems to require a few flags enabled
on the `lighthouse` beacon client including `--always-prefer-builder-payload` and `--disable-peer-scoring`

Users are recommended to use [`examples/capella-mev.yaml`](./examples/capella-mev.yaml); as inspiration for reliable payload
delivery.
