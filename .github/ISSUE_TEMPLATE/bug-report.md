<!-- Ethereum package is meant for strictly development purposes. It is not suitable for production use, and the use of production setup will always be actively discouraged. 
Please note that all issues related to setting up ethereum package in a production environment e.g:
- Setup a long running permanent network
- Exposing services for the public - rpc/beacon/tooling endpoints
- Syncing external nodes to an already running enclave
- Running testnet/mainnet validators
- Any other issues that smell like production use
Any issues that are related to to the above mentioned topics/related to running kurtosis with ethereum-package in a production like environment will be automatically closed. By opening an issue you agree to these terms.  -->
