Prometheus launcher that aggregates metrics from all Ethereum network components including execution clients, consensus clients, validators, and additional services.

## Key Integration Pattern
- Collects metrics endpoints from all deployed services via context objects
- Configures Prometheus jobs with appropriate labels and scrape intervals for each service type

## Important Constraints
- All services must expose metrics endpoints before Prometheus configuration
- Supports dynamic configuration of resource limits and retention policies
