# Validator Client Component

Multi-client validator orchestration for Ethereum Package test environments.

## Key Integration Pattern
- Adapter pattern for supporting multiple validator clients (Lighthouse, Lodestar, Nimbus, Prysm, Teku, Vero)
- Each client implementation follows standardized get_config() interface
- Shared configuration and port management through vc_shared module

## Important Constraints
- Validator clients must connect to beacon nodes via HTTP API
- Each client requires keystore files and proper slashing protection initialization
- Port allocation must be coordinated across metrics, keymanager API, and other services

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use participant configuration to determine client-specific parameters
- Always include proper tolerations and node selectors for Kubernetes deployments
- Maintain consistent error handling and logging patterns across client implementations
