Core orchestration layer that coordinates deployment of complete Ethereum networks with multiple execution and consensus client implementations.

## Key Architectural Pattern
- Participant-based architecture where each participant represents a complete node (EL+CL+VC+signer)
- Network launcher strategies handle different deployment types (devnet, public, shadowfork, ephemery)
- Service orchestration through Kurtosis plan API for containerized deployments

## Important Constraints  
- Network genesis timing must account for all service startup delays
- Maintain participant independence while coordinating shared resources (bootnodes, genesis data)
- Port allocation and service discovery must be deterministic for cross-component communication
