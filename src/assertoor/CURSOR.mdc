Assertoor launcher that orchestrates comprehensive Ethereum network testing across consensus and execution clients.

## Key Integration Pattern
- Connects to multiple client pairs via HTTP/RPC endpoints for cross-client validation
- Supports execution/consensus snooper integration for enhanced monitoring capabilities

## Important Constraints
- Requires rendered configuration templates with client endpoints and test parameters
- Test execution depends on validator availability and network readiness
