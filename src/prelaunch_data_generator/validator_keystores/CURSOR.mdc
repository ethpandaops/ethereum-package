# Validator Keystores Component

Generates and manages validator keystores compatible with multiple Ethereum consensus clients.

## Key Patterns
- Parallel keystore generation for large validator sets using Docker containers
- Client-specific keystore format transformation (Prysm, Nimbus, Teku)
- Artifact-based file distribution for generated keystores

## Critical Constraints
- Always set appropriate file permissions (0600 for secrets, 0777 for Teku keys)
- Prysm keystores require password file generation alongside keystores
- Validator ranges must be contiguous and non-overlapping across nodes
