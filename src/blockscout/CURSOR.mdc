Blockscout launcher that orchestrates deployment of explorer backend, verification service, and frontend.

## Architecture Patterns
- Three-service deployment pattern: backend API, smart contract verifier, and React frontend
- Postgres database dependency management via external package import
- Dynamic configuration based on EL client type (special handling for Erigon/Reth)

## Key Constraints
- Service startup order: postgres → verifier → backend → frontend
- Port allocation must be coordinated across three services to avoid conflicts
- Frontend requires backend service IP for API connectivity
