Execution layer orchestrator that manages multiple Ethereum execution clients through a unified launcher interface.

## Key Integration Pattern
- Use adapter pattern with standardized launcher interface for all execution clients
- Each client module must export new_*_launcher() and launch() functions
- Support dynamic client selection based on participant configuration

## Important Constraints
- Maintain client-agnostic port allocation and network configuration
- All clients must support JWT authentication for Engine API communication
- Preserve client-specific optimizations while ensuring consistent interface
