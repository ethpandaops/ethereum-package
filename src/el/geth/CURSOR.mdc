Geth execution client launcher that configures and deploys Geth nodes with flexible network support.

## Key Patterns
- Use launcher struct pattern for configuration passing
- Support multiple network types (mainnet, testnets, devnets, shadowforks)
- Configure via participant parameters with sensible defaults

## Integration Rules
- Port assignments must follow the standard EL port scheme (RPC: 8545, WS: 8546, Engine: 8551)
- Always include JWT authentication for Engine API
- Support both archive and snap sync modes based on gcmode parameter

## Critical Constraints
- Builder and Suave variants require specific API extensions (mev/flashbots, suavex)
- Archive mode requires hash-based state scheme until path-based storage is supported
- Shadowfork networks require special initialization and override parameters
