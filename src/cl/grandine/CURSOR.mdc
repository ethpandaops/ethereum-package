Grandine consensus client launcher that configures and deploys Grandine beacon nodes as part of the ethereum-package infrastructure.

## Key Integration Pattern
- Implements the standard CL launcher interface with support for beacon node, validator client, and keymanager API configurations
- Integrates with execution clients via Engine API using JWT authentication

## Important Constraints
- Runs as "grandine" user in container - cannot write to root directories
- Supports checkpoint sync, perfect PeerDAS mode, and supernode configurations
- Uses Teku-style keystore format for validator keys
