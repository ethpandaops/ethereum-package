Teku consensus client launcher that configures and deploys Teku beacon nodes as part of the ethereum-package infrastructure.

## Key Integration Pattern
- Implements the standard CL launcher interface with full beacon node and optional validator client configurations
- Integrates with execution clients via Engine API using JWT authentication with flexible snooper support

## Important Constraints
- Runs as "teku" user in container - write operations restricted to /data/teku paths
- Supports checkpoint sync, perfect PeerDAS mode with node key assignment, and supernode configurations
- Uses Teku-specific keystore format with separate keys and secrets directories
