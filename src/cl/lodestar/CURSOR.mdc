Lodestar consensus client launcher that configures and deploys TypeScript-based beacon nodes within the ethereum-package framework.

## Primary Integration Pattern
- Implements standardized CL launcher interface using Starlark service configuration
- Supports multiple execution clients via JWT-authenticated Engine API connections
- Enables optional blobber sidecar for blob propagation when configured

## Key Constraints
- Must maintain compatibility with all network types (mainnet, testnets, devnets, ephemery)
- Resource allocations must account for TypeScript runtime overhead
- Checkpoint sync configuration required for faster initial synchronization
