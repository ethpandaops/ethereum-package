Lighthouse consensus client launcher that configures and deploys Lighthouse beacon nodes with optional blobber sidecar.

## Key Integration Pattern
- Follows standardized consensus client launcher pattern with configurable service parameters
- Supports snooper mode for execution client proxying and blobber sidecar for blob propagation

## Important Constraints
- Must coordinate with execution layer client via JWT-authenticated Engine API
- Requires specific port assignments for discovery (TCP/UDP/QUIC), HTTP API, and metrics
