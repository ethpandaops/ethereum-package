Nimbus consensus layer client launcher that configures and deploys Nimbus beacon nodes.

## Key Integration Pattern
- Implements standard CL launcher interface with launch() and factory functions
- Supports both integrated validator and separate validator client modes
- Handles snooper integration for execution client monitoring

## Important Constraints
- Nimbus requires pre-existing data directory (must be created before bind-mount)
- Limited to 4 threads to prevent crashes on high-CPU hosts
- Requires doppelganger-detection disabled for proper operation
