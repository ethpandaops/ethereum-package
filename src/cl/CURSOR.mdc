Consensus layer orchestration that manages deployment of multiple Ethereum consensus clients via unified launcher interface.

## Key Integration Pattern
- Unified launcher pattern for all consensus clients (Lighthouse, Lodestar, Nimbus, Prysm, Teku, Grandine)
- Centralized port management and service discovery through cl_context
- Coordinated bootnode establishment for network formation

## Important Constraints
- First launched CL node becomes network bootnode for peer discovery
- All clients must implement standard launcher interface with launch() method
- Maintains EL-CL pairing through el_cl_data mapping structure
