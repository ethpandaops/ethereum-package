Prysm consensus layer client launcher that configures and deploys Prysm beacon nodes within the Ethereum package.

## Key Integration Pattern
Implements standardized consensus client interface with configurable network parameters, checkpoint sync, and monitoring endpoints.

## Important Constraints
- Must provide execution endpoint for engine API communication
- Requires JWT authentication for secure EL-CL communication
- Supports both mainnet and custom network configurations
