Network launcher that coordinates different Ethereum network initialization strategies including devnets, public networks, shadowforks, and ephemery.

## Key Architectural Patterns
- Strategy pattern for different network types (devnet, public, shadowfork, ephemery)
- Each launcher handles specific genesis configuration and initialization logic
- Coordinates with prelaunch data generators for validator keystores and genesis data

## Important Constraints
- Genesis timestamp calculation must account for CL node startup times
- Network-specific configurations must be fetched and validated before launch
- Parallel keystore generation is optional based on performance requirements
